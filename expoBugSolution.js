The solution often involves a combination of approaches and is highly dependent on the specific error message received.  Strategies that might solve the issue include:

1. **Clean the Android build:**  Delete the `android` and `node_modules` folders in your project and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. **Update dependencies:** Ensure all your dependencies (including Expo and its core components) are updated to their latest versions. Use `expo upgrade` and update package.json if needed.
3. **Invalidate cache:** Clear the cache for Gradle and your Android build tools.  The exact steps vary for different OS, but usually involves deleting specific folders. 
4. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Examine your `package.json` file to identify potential conflicts between packages.  Consider using a dependency resolution tool or manually resolving the conflicting versions. 
5. **Android Studio inspection:** If you have access to Android Studio, you can try importing the project as an Android Studio project and check the build output there for a more detailed error message.
6. **Reinstall Expo CLI:**  As a last resort, try reinstalling the Expo CLI (`npm uninstall -g expo-cli && npm install -g expo-cli`).
7. **Check Android SDK and Build tools:** Make sure that your Android SDK and build tools are up to date and correctly configured. 

Remember to always provide the complete error message when seeking help. This is crucial in diagnosing the exact cause of the problem.  If the problem persists, carefully examine the logs for detailed information.
