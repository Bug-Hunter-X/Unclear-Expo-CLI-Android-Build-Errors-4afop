This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The build process fails with a cryptic error message, often related to Gradle or Android build tools. The error message itself is not very helpful in pinpointing the root cause.  The project might build successfully on other machines or environments, making it harder to debug.  Often, the error doesn't point to a specific file or line of code within the application code.  Instead, it usually involves issues with dependencies, conflicting versions, or problems within the Android build system itself.
