# Unclear Expo CLI Android Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a recurring issue with the Expo CLI when building Android applications. The build process fails with unhelpful error messages, making debugging difficult.

The problem is not consistently reproducible across different environments. A build that works on one machine may fail on another with no clear reason.

**Reproducing the issue (may vary depending on your setup):**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo prebuild`
3. Run `expo build:android`

You may encounter a Gradle error, a build tool error, or another Android-related issue that does not clearly point to a fix in your application code.

**Solutions attempted (and why they failed, if applicable):**
